# arduino_robot

This is example of simple robot based on Arduino UNO with ultrasonic module, two infared obstacle sensors and micro servo motor. 
My robot have ability to go straight and go around obstacles. If the robot "sees" obstacle to the right or left it reads information from infared obstacle sensor and transmits 
it to microcontroller. After getting this information robot choose wheel that it have to turn to the side. Robot use an ultrasonic module that also helps to "see" an obstacles 
but in front of robot. Ultrasonic module fixed to micro servo motor which is rotates 45 degrees. 

Code is loading to microcontroller that connected by arduino IDE.
